		<p>The Bullboxer Pit is a mixed breed dog — a cross between the Boxer and American Pit Bull Terrier dog breeds. Powerful, faithful, and energetic, these pups inherited some of the best traits from both of their parents.</p>
		<p>Bullboxer Pits are also sometimes called the Pixoter or American Bullboxer. You may find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add one of these pups to your home!</p>
