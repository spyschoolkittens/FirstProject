<h1>The Release of SSAS</h1>

<h2>Kit's Journal Entry</h2>

<p>I woke up excited. Today was the day ''Spy School At Sea'' was being released! Nothing big happened on the wiki, until around 12:30. 

Nick started adding new pages for the new characters in the book. Even though I haven't read SSAS yet, I fixed the format, grammar, and links on the pages. We make a great team! 

Nick also got the lucky 10,000th edit badge and now we are tied for first on the leaderboard with 1,390 achievement points! 

**This is from the lesson for future reference: I also snuck in a new tag. I put it in the head. What do you think it’s going to do? What is in the head does not appear on the page. Where is the title going to appear? Save your code and look at it in the browser and find the title. Where is it?

It shows up in the tab. Later we’ll add a little image to the tab as well.

Play around with your page and title. Can you make anything useful yet? Save what you do if you start writing anything useful because you can come back later and pretty it up, when we get to styling the page.</p>
