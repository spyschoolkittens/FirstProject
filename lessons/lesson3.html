<h1>Kit's Wolves</h1>

<p>	Kit has three wolves.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, modus soluta contentiones vis at, summo voluptaria mediocritatem nam ex, quo eu vidit fuisset consulatu. Dolorem expetenda ne est.

<p>The three wolves are called Namid, Niko, and Nayeli. If I tab there, does it work? Ok, it doesn't.</p>

Can you see    four spaces?

	What about a tab?<pre></p>

<h3>haha!</h3><p>My spaces worked, except they're a different font. How to fix that I don't know.</p>

<p>Let's try something else with the spaces. A website called BitDegree-learn, says that & n b s p ; (I'm spacing it out so it won't do the command hopefully) is the non-breakable space. Let's try it.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah's first wolf was Namid.</p>
